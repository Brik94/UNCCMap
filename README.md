# UNCCMap
A mobile interactive version of the UNCC Map

Currently have a working searchable database of just the academic buildings.

The goal is to have Google Maps integreted. So when you search for a building by name or code, the screen will jump straight to
that location via maps fragment. Will also provide directions sending you directly to Google Maps.
